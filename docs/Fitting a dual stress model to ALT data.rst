Fitting a dual stress model to ALT data
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Before reading this section it is recommended that readers are familiar with the concepts of `fitting probability distributions <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fitting%20a%20specific%20distribution%20to%20data.html>`_, `probability plotting <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Probability%20plots.html>`_, and have an understanding of `what accelerated life testing (ALT) involves <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/What%20is%20Accelerated%20Life%20Testing.html>`_.

The module `reliability.ALT_fitters` contains 24 `ALT models <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Equations%20of%20ALT%20models.html>`_; 12 of these models are for single stress and 12 are for dual stress. This section details the dual stress models, though the process for `fitting single stress models <https://reliability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Fitting%20a%20single%20stress%20model%20to%20ALT%20data.html>`_ is similar. The decision to use a single stress or dual stress model depends entirely on your data. If your data has two stresses that are being changed then you will use a dual stress model.

The following dual stress models are available within ALT_fitters:

-    Fit_Weibull_Dual_Exponential
-    Fit_Weibull_Power_Exponential
-    Fit_Weibull_Dual_Power
-    Fit_Lognormal_Dual_Exponential
-    Fit_Lognormal_Power_Exponential
-    Fit_Lognormal_Dual_Power
-    Fit_Normal_Dual_Exponential
-    Fit_Normal_Power_Exponential
-    Fit_Normal_Dual_Power
-    Fit_Exponential_Dual_Exponential
-    Fit_Exponential_Power_Exponential
-    Fit_Exponential_Dual_Power

Each of the ALT models works in a very similar way so the documentation below can be applied to all of the dual stress models with minor modifications to the parameter names of the outputs. The following documentation is for the Weibull_Dual_Exponential model.

Inputs:

-    failures - an array or list of the failure times.
-    failure_stress_1 - an array or list of the corresponding stress 1 (such as temperature) at which each failure occurred. This must match the length of failures as each failure is tied to a failure stress.
-    failure_stress_2 - an array or list of the corresponding stress 2 (such as humidity) at which each failure occurred. This must match the length of failures as each failure is tied to a failure stress.
-    right_censored - an array or list of all the right censored failure times
-    right_censored_stress_1 - an array or list of the corresponding stress 1 (such as temperature) at which each right_censored data point was obtained. This must match the length of right_censored as each right_censored value is tied to a right_censored stress.
-    right_censored_stress_2 - an array or list of the corresponding stress 1 (such as humidity) at which each right_censored data point was obtained. This must match the length of right_censored as each right_censored value is tied to a right_censored stress.
-    use_level_stress - [stress_1, stress_2]. A two element list or array of the use level stresses at which you want to know the mean life. Optional input.
-    print_results - True/False. Default is True
-    show_probability_plot - True/False. Default is True
-    show_life_stress_plot - True/False. Default is True
-    CI - confidence interval for estimating confidence limits on parameters. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is 0.95 for 95% CI.
-    optimizer - 'TNC', 'L-BFGS-B', 'powell'. Default is 'TNC'. These are all bound constrained methods. If the bound constrained method fails, nelder-mead will be used. If nelder-mead fails the initial guess (using least squares) will be returned with a warning.

-    loglik - Log Likelihood (as used in Minitab and Reliasoft)

Example 1
---------

In the following example, we will fit the Normal-Dual-Exponential model to an ALT dataset obtained from a temperature-voltage dual stress test. This dataset can be found in `reliability.Datasets`. We want to know the mean life at the use level stress of 330 Kelvin, 2.5 Volts so the parameter use_level_stress is specified. All other values are left as defaults and the results and plot are shown.

.. code:: python

    from reliability.Datasets import ALT_temperature_voltage
    from reliability.ALT_fitters import Fit_Normal_Dual_Exponential
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    data = ALT_temperature_voltage()
    Fit_Normal_Dual_Exponential(failures=data.failures, failure_stress_1=data.failure_stress_temp, failure_stress_2=data.failure_stress_voltage,use_level_stress=[330,2.5])
    plt.show()

In the results above we see 3 tables of results; the fitted parameters (along with their confidence bounds) dataframe, the change of parameters dataframe, and the goodness of fit dataframe. For the change of parameters dataframe the "original mu" and "original sigma" are the fitted values for the Normal_2P distribution that is fitted to the data at each stress (shown on the probability plot by the dashed lines). The "new mu" and "new sigma" are from the Normal_Dual_Exponential model. The sigma change is extremely important as it allows us to identify whether the fitted ALT model is appropriate at each stress level. A sigma change of over 50% will trigger a warning to be printed informing the user that the failure mode may be changing across different stresses, or that the model is inappropriate for the data. The acceleration factor column will only be returned if the use level stress is provided since acceleration factor is a comparison of the life at the higher stress vs the use stress.

Example 2
---------

In this second example we will fit the Lognormal_Power_Exponential model. Instead of using an existing dataset we will create our own data using the function make_ALT_data. The results show that the fitted parameters agree well with the parameters we used to generate the data, as does the mean life at the use stress. This accuracy improves with more data.

Two of the outputs returned are the axes handles for the probability plot and the life-stress plot. These handles can be used to set certain values. In the example below we see the axes labels being set to custom values after the plots have been generated but before the plots have been displayed.

.. code:: python

    from reliability.Other_functions import make_ALT_data
    from reliability.ALT_fitters import Fit_Lognormal_Power_Exponential
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    use_level_stress = [150,3]
    ALT_data = make_ALT_data(distribution='Lognormal',life_stress_model='Power_Exponential',a=200,c=400,n=-0.5,sigma=0.5,stress_1=[500,400,350,420,245],stress_2=[12,8,6,9,10],number_of_samples=100,fraction_censored=0.5,seed=1,use_level_stress=use_level_stress)
    model = Fit_Lognormal_Power_Exponential(failures=ALT_data.failures, failure_stress_1=ALT_data.failure_stresses_1, failure_stress_2=ALT_data.failure_stresses_2, right_censored=ALT_data.right_censored, right_censored_stress_1=ALT_data.right_censored_stresses_1,right_censored_stress_2=ALT_data.right_censored_stresses_2, use_level_stress=use_level_stress)
    # this will change the xlabel on the probability plot
    model.probability_plot.set_xlabel('Time (hours)')
    # this will change the axes labels on the life-stress plot
    model.life_stress_plot.set_xlabel('Temperature $(^oK)$')
    model.life_stress_plot.set_ylabel('Voltage (kV)')
    model.life_stress_plot.set_zlabel('Life (hours)')

    print('The mean life at use stress of the true model is:',ALT_data.mean_life_at_use_stress)

.. note:: The 3D surface plot with scatter plot has a known visibility issue where the 3D surface will appear to be in front of the scatter plot even when it should be shown behind it. This `issue is internal to matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/faq.html#my-3d-plot-doesn-t-look-right-at-certain-viewing-angles>`_ and the only current fix is to change the plotting library to MayaVi.
