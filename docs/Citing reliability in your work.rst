Citing reliability in your work
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If `reliability` contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication, please acknowledge this contribution by citing the DOI `10.5281/zenodo.3938000 <https://zenodo.org/record/3938000>`_.

The following reference is using APA:

**Reid, M. (2021). Reliability – a Python library for reliability engineering (Version 0.5.7) [Computer software]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.3938000**

If you would like to use another referencing style, the details you may need are:

- **Author:** Matthew Reid
