About the author
''''''''''''''''

``reliability`` was written by Matthew Reid. Matthew is currently in his last semester of a Masters of Reliability Engineering at the
University of Maryland, and from 2020 he will be working as a reliability engineer in Melbourne, Australia. ``reliability`` was written because there were no dedicated reliability engineering libraries for Python, and Matthew found himself needing to use scipy.stats, lifelines, Minitab, MATLAB, JMP Pro, and his own Python scripts, for a variety of common reliability engineering tasks that were not available in one place.

This is Matthew's first Python library on PyPI and is a work in progress. In accordance with the `MIT license <https://github.com/MatthewReid854/reliability/blob/master/LICENCE>`_, every effort has been made to ensure the software is free of errors, however, no guarantees or warranties are provided in any form. Feedback on ``reliability`` is most welcome. If you find an error, have a suggestion, would like to request something to be included, or would like to contribute something, please raise an `issue <https://github.com/MatthewReid854/reliability/issues/>`_ on GitHub.
