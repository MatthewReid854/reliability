Recommended resources
'''''''''''''''''''''

The following collection of resources are things I have found useful during my reliability engineering studies and also while writing the Python reliability library. There are many other resources available (especially textbooks and academic papers), so I encourage you to do your own research. If you find something you think is worth adding here, please send me an email.

The listing of a resource or software package here does not imply my endorsement, and is only intended to give readers an understanding of the broad range of resources available. It is difficult to find a comprehensive list of software resources since most the producers of proprietary software rarely acknowledge the existence of any software other than their own. I have not used most of the paid software listed due to the high cost, so most of my comments in the paid software section are based purely on the content from their websites.

**Free software**

-    `Lifelines <https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ - a Python library for survival analysis. Very powerful collection of tools, only a few of which overlap with the Python reliability library.
-    `Parameter Solver v3.0 <https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload/SingleSoftware/Index/6>`_ - a biostatistics tool for quickly making some simple calculations with probability distributions.
-    `Orange <https://orange.biolab.si/>`_ - a standalone data mining and data visualization program that runs using Python. Beautifully interactive data analysis workflows with a large toolbox. Not much reliability related content but good for data preprocessing.
-    `R (Programming Language) - Survival analysis library <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_survival_analysis.htm>`_ - one of the more popular survival analysis libraries available in the open source commmunity.
-    `R (Programming Language) - Weibull Analysis for Reliability Engineering <https://github.com/openrelia/WeibullR.gallery>`_ - Life data analysis in the graphical tradition of Waloddi Weibull.
-    `CumFreq <https://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm>`_ - a program for cumulative frequency analysis with probability distribution fitting for a wide range of distributions. Limited functionality beyond fitting distributions.
-    `Fault Tree Analyser <https://www.fault-tree-analysis-software.com/fault-tree-analysis>`_ - A simple online tool where you can build a fault tree, give each branch a failure rate and run a variety of reports including reliability prediction at time, minimal cut sets, and several others.

**Paid software**

-    `Minitab <https://www.minitab.com/en-us/>`_ - a great collection of statistical tools. A few reliability focussed tools included.
-    `Reliasoft <https://www.reliasoft.com/products/reliability-analysis/weibull>`_ - the industry leader for reliability engineering software.
-    `SAS JMP <https://www.jmp.com/en_us/software/predictive-analytics-software.html>`_ - lots of statistical tools for data modelling and visualization. A few purpose built reliability tools. Its utility for reliability engineering will depend on your application. SAS has also released the `SAS University Edition <https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html>`_ which is a free software package that runs in VirtualBox and offers a reduced set of tools compared to the paid package.
-    `PTC Windchill <https://www.ptc.com/en/products/plm/capabilities/quality/>`_ - a powerful tool for risk and reliability. Similar to Reliasoft but it forms one part of the larger PTC suite of tools.
-    `Isograph Reliability Workbench <https://www.isograph.com/software/reliability-workbench/>`_ - A collection of tools designed specifically for reliability engineering.
-    `Item Software <https://www.itemsoft.com/reliability_prediction.html>`_ - A collection of tools for reliability engineering including FMECA, fault trees, reliability prediction, and many others.
-    `SuperSMITH <https://fultonfindings.com/>`_ - This software is designed specifically for reliability engineering and has many useful tools. The user interface looks like it is from the early 1990s but the methods used are no less relevant today. This software was developed alongside the New Weibull Handbook, an excellent resource for interpreting the results of reliability engineering software.
-   `RAM Commander <http://www.reliability-safety-software.com/products/ram-commander/>`_ - A software tool for Reliability and Maintainability Analysis and Prediction, Spares Optimisation, FMEA/FMECA, Testability, Fault Tree Analysis, Event Tree Analysis and Safety Assessment.
-   `RelCalc <http://t-cubed.com/features.htm>`_ - RelCalc for Windows automates the reliability prediction procedure of Telcordia SR-332, or MIL-HDBK-217, providing an alternative to tedious, time consuming, and error prone manual methods.
-   `@RISK <https://www.palisade.com/risk/key-features.asp>`_ - A comprehensive Excel addon that allows for distribution fitting, reliability modelling, MC simulation and much more.
-    `Quanterion Automated Reliability Toolkit (QuART) <https://www.quanterion.com/projects/quart/>`_ - A collection of reliability tools including reliability prediction, FMECA, derating, stress-strength interference, and many other. Quanterion produces several software products so their tools are not all available in one place.
-    `TopEvent FTA <https://www.fault-tree-analysis.com/>`_ - Fault Tree Analysis software. Tailored specifically for fault tree analysis so it lacks other RAM tools but it is good at its intended function. A demo version is available with size and data export limitations.
-   `Maintenance Aware Design (MADe) <https://www.phmtechnology.com/>`_ - FMECA and RCM software that is extremely useful at the product design stage to inform the design and service plan which then improves the inherent reliability and maintainability. There is an academic license which allows non-profit users to run the software for free.
