Recommended resources
'''''''''''''''''''''

The following collection of resources are things I have found useful during my reliability engineering studies and also while writing ``reliability``. There are many other resources available (especially textbooks and academic papers), so I encourage you to do your own research. If you find something you think is worth adding here, please send me an email.

**Textbooks**

-    Reliability Engineering and Risk Analysis: A practical Guide, Third Edition (2017), by M. Modarres, M. Kaminskiy, and V. Krivtsov.
-    Probabilistic Physics of Failure Approach to Reliability (2017), by M. Modarres, M. Amiri, and C. Jackson.
-    `Probability Distributions Used in Reliability Engineering (2011), by A. O'Conner, M. Modarres, and A. Mosleh. <https://crr.umd.edu/sites/crr.umd.edu/files/Free%20Ebook%20Probability%20Distributions%20Used%20in%20Reliability%20Engineering.pdf>`_
-    Practical Reliability Engineering, Fifth Edition (2012), by P. O'Conner and A. Kleyner.
-    Recurrent Events Data Analysis for Product Repairs, Disease Recurrences, and Other Applications (2003), by W. Nelson

**Free software**

-    `Lifelines <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/blob/master/README.md>`_ - a Python library for survival analysis.
-    `Parameter Solver v3.0 <https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/SoftwareDownload/SingleSoftware/Index/6>`_ - a biostatistics tool for quickly making some simple calculations with probability distributions.
-    `Orange <https://orange.biolab.si/>`_ - a standalone data mining and data visualization program that runs using Python. Beautifully interactive data analysis workflows with a large toolbox. Not much reliability related content but good for data preprocessing.
-    `R Studio - Survival analysis library <https://r-posts.com/steps-to-perform-survival-analysis-in-r/>`_ - one of the more popular survival analysis libraries available in the open source commmunity.
-    `CumFreq <https://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm>`_ - a program for cumulative frequency analysis with probability distribution fitting for a wide range of distributions. Limited functionality beyond fitting distributions.

**Paid software**

-    `Minitab <https://www.minitab.com/en-us/>`_ - a great collection of statistical tools. A few reliability focussed tools included.
-    `Reliasoft <https://www.reliasoft.com/products/reliability-analysis/weibull>`_ - the industry leader for reliability engineering software.
-    `SAS JMP <https://www.jmp.com/en_us/software/predictive-analytics-software.html>`_ - lots of statistical tools for data modelling and visualization. A few purpose built reliability tools. Its utility for reliability engineering will depend on your application.
-    `PTC Windchill <https://www.ptc.com/en/products/plm/capabilities/quality/>`_ - a powerful tool for risk and reliability. Similar to Reliasoft but it forms one part of the larger PTC suite of tools.
-    `Isograph Reliability Workbench <https://www.isograph.com/software/reliability-workbench/>`_ - A collection of tools designed specifically for reliability engineering.
-    `TopEvent FTA <https://www.fault-tree-analysis.com/>`_ - Fault Tree Analysis software. Tailored specifically for fault tree analysis so it lacks other RAM tools but it is good at its intended function. A demo version exists with size and data export limitations.
-   `MADe (Maintenance Aware Design) <https://www.phmtechnology.com/>`_ - FMECA and RCM software that is extremely useful at the product design stage to inform the design and service plan which then improves the inherent reliability and maintainability.

**Websites for Reliability**

-    `Reliawiki <http://reliawiki.org/index.php/Life_Data_Analysis_Reference_Book>`_ - an excellent reference written by Reliasoft that is intended largely as a guide to reliability engineering when using Reliasoft's software but is equally as good to understand concepts without using their software.
-    `Reliability Analytics Toolkit <https://reliabilityanalyticstoolkit.appspot.com/>`_ - a collection of tools which run using the Google App Engine.
-    `Univariate distributions relationships <http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/chart/UDR/UDR.html>`_ - an excellent resource for understanding more about probability distributions and how they are related. Some strange parametrisations are used in the documentation.
-    `Kijima G-renewal process <http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageGRP.jsp>`_ - an online calculator for simulating the G-renewal process.
-    `Prediction of future recurrent events <http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageGRPinverse_1.jsp>`_ - an online calculator for predicting future recurrent events with different underlying probability functions.
-    `Maintenance optimization <http://www.soft4structures.com/WeibullGRP/JSPageMTN.jsp>`_ - an online calculator for optimal replacement policy (time) under Kijima imperfect repair model.
-    `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering>`_ - it's always worth checking if there's an article on there about the topic you're trying to understand.
-    `e-Fatigue <https://www.efatigue.com/constantamplitude/stressconcentration/>`_ - This website provides stress concentration factors (Kt) for various notched geometries. You will need this if using the functions for fracture machanics in the Physics of Failure section.
-    `Reliasoft's Accelerated Life Testing Data Analysis Reference <http://reliawiki.com/index.php/Accelerated_Life_Testing_Data_Analysis_Reference>`_
-    `Reliasoft's collection of Military Directives, Handbooks and Standards Related to Reliability <https://www.weibull.com/knowledge/milhdbk.htm>`_

**Websites for Mathematics**

-    `Wolfram Alpha <https://www.wolframalpha.com/>`_ - an amazing computational knowledge engine. Great for checking your calculations.
-    `Derivative calculator <https://www.derivative-calculator.net/>`_ - calculates derivatives. Slightly more user friendly input method than Wolfram alpha and doesn't time out as easily for big calculations.
-    `Integral calculator <https://www.integral-calculator.com/>`_ - calculates integrals. Slightly more user friendly input method than Wolfram alpha and doesn't time out as easily for big calculations.
-    `Cross Validated <https://stats.stackexchange.com/>`_ - an online forum for asking statistics and mathematics questions. Check for existing answers before posting your own question.

**Getting free access to academic papers**

-    `arXiv <https://arXiv.org>`_ - a database run by Cornell university that provides open access to over 1.5 million academic papers that have been submitted. If you can't find it here then check on Sci-Hub.
-    `Sci-Hub <https://sci-hub.tw/>`_ - paste in a DOI to get a copy of the academic paper. Accessing academic knowledge should be free and this site makes it possible.
