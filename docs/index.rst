*reliability* is a Python library for `reliability engineering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering>`_ and `survival analysis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis>`_. It significantly extends the functionality of scipy.stats and also includes many specialist tools that are otherwise only available in proprietary software.
